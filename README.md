## Known Issues & Limitations 🛠️

- There is a problem with the .exe file available in the repo; settings will not be saved. (FIXED IN V1.1.0)
- API Rate Limits: Spotify limits the number of requests. If you encounter issues, try again after some time.
- Large Playlists: The script fetches playlists in batches of 100. Ensure your internet connection is stable for large playlists.
- Authentication Timeout: If your session expires, you'll need to re-authenticate via the browser.
## Future Improvements 🌟

- Automatic API fetching from spotify.
- Automatic Playlist transfer between Stream platforms like amazon and apple.
- Progress bar? Maybe IDK
